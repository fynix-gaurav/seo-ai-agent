# SEO-AI-AGENT - Backend Services

This repository contains the backend services for **SEO-AOI-AGENT**, a scalable, industry-level platform that automates a proprietary SEO content workflow. The system operates as an AI Co-pilot, a specialized "SEO Automation Agent," that transforms a single keyword into a fully researched, strategically differentiated, and written content package.

## üöÄ Project Vision

Our primary goal is to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable platform that serves as a co-pilot for content strategists. The system is designed with an "asynchronous first" architecture to handle complex, long-running AI tasks while providing a responsive user experience.

### Core Features (Roadmap)
* **Phase 1: Strategy & Outlining Engine:** Autonomous generation of data-driven, structured content outlines from a single keyword.
* **Phase 2: Content Co-pilot Engine:** An agentic "Writer-Editor" workflow that transforms outlines into high-quality, full-length article drafts.
* **Phase 3: Optimization & Enrichment:** Advanced services like an Internal Linking Architect (RAG) and qualitative content scoring.
* **Phase 4: Final Assets & Security:** Generation of meta-descriptions, social posts, and implementation of JWT-based user authentication.
* **Phase 5: MLOps & Deployment:** Full containerization and deployment to a production environment on GCP.
