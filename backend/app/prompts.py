**CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **De-duplicate Ruthlessly:** Review all H3s under each H2. Identify and merge any subheadings that are semantically identical or highly similar. Consolidate them into a single, well-phrased H3.
2.  **Consolidate and Rephrase:** Rephrase the final headings to be clear, engaging, and unique. Ensure a logical flow.
3.  **Add a Strategic Angle (The "Value-Add"):** Identify one or two unique, high-value topics or angles that are missing from the draft. Add these as new, compelling H3s to the most relevant section to make our article stand out.
4.  **Maintain Structure:** Your final output MUST be a JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided `SeoOutline` schema. Do not add any conversational text.
